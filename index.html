  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide documents and supports the use of a prototype Measure Calculation Tool for reporting and calculating FHIR-based digital quality measures (dQMs).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Measure Calculation Tool is a software system that facilitates gathering quality reporting data, performing 
    measure validation and calculation, and submitting reporting data for a provider. This process makes use of FHIR 
    standard APIs implemented by vendor systems at provider sites, reducing the overall burden of quality reporting 
    by eliminating the currently required transformation from proprietary data models to the conceptual model used 
    for specifying eCQMs (Quality Data Model). By using FHIR as a standard data model for the expression of quality 
    measures, quality reporting data exchange, measure calculation, and reporting submission can be implemented in a 
    single standard way, rather than requiring each vendor system to interpret and apply measure specifications.
  </p>
	<a name="use-case-overview">  </a>
	<h3>Use Case Overview</h3>
  <p>The following diagram illustrates the primary use case for the measure calculation tool: Reporting Submission
  </p>
  <img src="MeasureCalculationTool.png" alt="Measure Calculation Tool Use Case Overview" height="469" width="600"/>
	<p>The participants in this use case are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Reporting Client:</b> A prototype user-interface that demonstrates the reporting submission workflow</li>
    <li><b>Measure Calculation Tool:</b> The measure calculation tool prototype as a RESTful web service</li>
    <li><b>Knowledge Repository:</b> A measure repository providing measure specifications and data requirements features as described by the Measure Repository Service capability statement in the Quality Measure IG</li>
    <li><b>Terminology Service:</b> A measure terminology service supporting terminology used by measures as described by the Measure Terminology Service capability statement in the Quality Measure IG</li>
    <li><b>Provider Site System:</b> Clinical systems with patient data exposed via a US Core/QI Core compliant FHIR server</li>
    <li><b>Receiving System:</b> Receiving system that receives the calculation and patient data submission as described by the Receiving System capability statement in the Data Exchange for Quality Measures IG</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, this use case consists of the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Initiate:</b> For the selected organization, measure, population, and reporting period, determine and retrieve specific data and terminology requirements</li>
    <li><b>Gather:</b> For each facility and the population, gather the relevant data from the provider site systems</li>
    <li><b>Validate:</b> For each gathered data element, validate the data is present and conforms to expected profiles</li>
    <li><b>Calculate:</b> For each individual, as well as the population, calculate the relevant measure score and determine evaluated resources</li>
    <li><b>Submit:</b> After reviewing any validation issues, submit the calculated score and relevant supporting data to the receiving system</li>
  </ul>

A learning health system is characterized by continuous learning cycles, which encourage the creation of new knowledge that can be consumed by a wide variety of electronic health information systems. This knowledge can support effective decision-making and lead to improved health outcomes.” </li>
    <li><b>HAPI FHIR Service:</b> HAPI FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is an open-source Java-based library and toolkit for building HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) compliant applications. A HAPI FHIR service is a web service built using this library.</li>
    <li><b>Interoperability:</b> refers to the ability of different healthcare information technology systems and devices to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged.

Maven uses a project object model (POM) to describe a project's configuration, including dependencies, plugins, and build profiles. It also provides a set of standard project structures and lifecycle phases that can be customized to suit the needs of different projects.</li>
    <li><b>Measure calculation tool (MCT):</b> A tool that maps the quality measure criterion to the corresponding API endpoint and aggregates the data to perform the requested analysis. Such a tool could be housed within individual provider EHRs, developed and maintained by external health IT vendors, and/or run by CMS for the purpose of quality measurement. Open-core software: a platform with a standard core architecture available for use under an opensource license supporting an ecosystem of offerings of additional proprietary, closed source add-on functionalities, and services that are not required. </li>
    <li><b>Population health:</b> An approach utilizing non-traditional partnerships among various sectors of the community: public health, industry, academia, healthcare, local government entities, etc. to achieve positive health outcomes.

    <li><b>Service-oriented architecture:</b> As defined by ONC in its Interoperability Roadmap, “Service-oriented architecture is based on distinct pieces of software providing application functionality as services to other applications via a protocol. Depending on the service design approach taken, each service-oriented architecture service is designed to perform one or more activities by implementing one or more service operations. As a result, each service is built as a discrete piece of code. This makes it possible to reuse the code in different ways throughout the application by changing only the way an individual service interoperates with other services that make up the application, versus making code changes to the service itself. Service-oriented architecture design principles are used during software development and integration.” </li>
    <li><b>Spring Boot:</b> Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework for building standalone, production-ready applications. It provides a set of pre-configured components and tools that streamline the application development process.</li>

United States Core Data for Interoperability Plus (USCDI+): A new initiative established by ONC to support the identification and establishment of domain or program-specific datasets that will operate as extensions to the existing USCDI. In particular, USCDI+ is a service that ONC will provide to federal partners who have a need to establish, harmonize, and advance the use of interoperable datasets that extend beyond the core data in the USCDI in order to meet agency-specific programmatic requirements. US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG): A guide based on FHIR Version R4 that defines the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data. This guide is based on the USCDI requirements.   </li>
    <li><b>Use Case:</b> A use case is a description of how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal or outcome. It outlines the steps involved in the user's interactions with the system and the expected results.</li>
    <li><b>User Interface (UI):</b> A user interface is the means by which a user interacts with a computer system or application. It encompasses all the visual and interactive elements of an application, including buttons, menus, forms, and text.</li>
    <li><b>Yarn:</b> Yarn is a package manager for Node.js-based applications. It provides a more efficient and reliable way to manage dependencies than the built-in npm package manager. Yarn uses a deterministic algorithm to ensure that each time a package is installed, the same dependencies and versions are installed, regardless of the system on which it is installed. This helps to ensure consistency and reduce the likelihood of compatibility issues.  </li>
