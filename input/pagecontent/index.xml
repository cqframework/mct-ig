  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide documents and supports the use of a prototype Measure Calculation Tool for reporting and calculating FHIR-based digital quality measures (dQMs).
  </p>

	<h3>Use Case Overview</h3>
  <p>The following diagram illustrates the primary use case for the measure calculation tool: Reporting Submission
  </p>
  <img src="MeasureCalculationTool.png" alt="Measure Calculation Tool Use Case Overview"/>
	<p>The participants in this use case are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Reporting Client:</b> A prototype user-interface that demonstrates the reporting submission workflow</li>
    <li><b>Measure Calculation Tool:</b> The measure calculation tool prototype as a RESTful web service</li>
    <li><b>Knowledge Repository:</b> A measure repository providing measure specifications and data requirements features</li>
    <li><b>Terminology Service:</b> A measure terminology service supporting terminology used by measures</li>
    <li><b>Provider Site System:</b> Clinical systems with patient data exposed via a US Core/QI Core compliant FHIR server</li>
    <li><b>Receiving System:</b> Receiving system that receives the calculation and patient data submission</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, this use case consists of the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Initiate:</b> For the selected organization, measure, population, and reporting period, determine and retrieve specific data and terminology requirements</li>
    <li><b>Gather:</b> For each facility and the population, gather the relevant data from the provider site systems</li>
    <li><b>Validate: For each gathered data element, validate the data is present and conforms to expected profiles</b></li>
    <li><b>Calculate:</b> For each individual, as well as the population, calculate the relevant measure score and determine evaluated resources</li>
    <li><b>Submit:</b> After reviewing any validation issues, submit the calculated score and relevant supporting data to the receiving system</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more detailed discussion of the use case and implementation, see the Technical Requirements topic.</p>
