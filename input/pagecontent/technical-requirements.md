|Actors:|Quality Manager<br/>Hospital (EHR FHIR Endpoint)<br/>Measure Calculation Tool<br/>Knowlege Repository<br/>Terminiology Service<br/>Reporting Client|
|Description:|This use case describes the way a hospital will validate and certify that it can submit a FHIR specified hospital level quality measure for voluntary reporting periods for CY 2023. The user accesses the portal with their HARP account, selects a facility affiliate to be validated, and selects the Validate/Certify action|
|Preconditions:|The EHR FHIR Endpoint has been populated with the Validation Data Bundle<br/>All facility information is registered and available via Organization/Location resources (TBD: need to identify where this will come from)<br/>The measure content to be used for Valiation is available via the KR interface (can be mocked as a pre-packaged bundle)<br/>The terminology content is available via the TS interface (can be mocked as a pre-packaged bundle)|
|Postconditions:|The MeasureReport calculation produces the expected results from the validation data<br/>A Validation MeasureReport is calculated submitted to the Receiving System|
|Normal Course:|A user initiates the validation process via the Reporting Client, selecting the facility to be validated.<br/>For the Validation measure, the measure calculation tool gathers data requirements and terminology to determine FHIR queries to be executed<br/>For the validation facility, the measure calculation tool uses the facilities FHIR endpoint to evaluate the FHIR queries and gather all relevant data<br/>For the validation data, the measure calculation tool validates the data conforms to expected profiles<br/>For the validation data, the measure calculation tool evaluates the measure using the validated data as the data source<br/>The Reporting Client displays the result of the Measure Calculation to the user<br/>The user confirms the results and agrees to submit the Validation<br/>The Measure Calculation Tool posts the resulting MeasureReport to the Receiving System|
|Alternative Courses:|N/A|
|Exceptions:|If the data doesn't meet reporting requirements, the facility cannot be validated<br/>If the data doesn't conform to appropriate profiles, steps need to be taken to address, report violations as part of the reponse and require a resubmit|

|Actors:|Quality Manager<br/>Hospital (EHR FHIR Endpoint)<br/>Measure Calculation Tool<br/>Knowledge Repository<br/>Terminology Service<br/>Receiving System<br/>Reporting Client|
|Description:|This use case describes the way a hospital will submit a FHIR specified hospital level quality measure for all 3 out of the four voluntary reporting periods for CY 2023. The user accesses the portal with their HARP account, selects all facility affiliates, selects the program (IQR) and the measure (TBD) and checks the measure requirements, and agrees to begin (**PUSH**) the data|
|Preconditions:|The EHR FHIR Endpoint has been validated (with the Validation Use Case)<br/>All relevant patient data is available via the EHR FHIR Endpoint<br/>All facility information is registered and available via Organization/Location resources (TBD: need to identfy where this will come from)<br/>All attributed patient ids are available via a Group resource (TBD: need to identify the source for this as well)<br/>The measure content is available via the KR interface (can be mocked as a pre-packaged bundle)<br/>The terminology content is available via the TS interface (can be mocked as a pre-packaged bundle)|
|Postconditions:|The relevant patient data from all sites is stored in the Reciving System<br/>The MeasureReport calculation procduces the expected results from the input data<br/>The MeasureReport is submitted to the Receiving System|
|Normal Course:|A user initiates the process via the Reporting Client, selecting the facilities, measure, and reporting period.<br/>For each measure, the measure calculation tool gathers data requirements and terminology to determine FHIR queries to be executed<br/>For each facility, the measure calculation tool uses the facilities FHIR endpoint to evaluate the FHIR queries and gather all relevant data<br/>For all relevant data, the measure calculation tool validates the data conforms to expected profiles<br/>For all relevant data, the measure calculation tool submits that data to the Receving System<br/>The Measure Calculation Tool evaluates the measure using the Receiving System as the data source<br/>The Reporting Client displays the result of the Measure Calculation to the user<br/>The user confirms the results and agrees to submit<br/>The Measure Calculation Tool posts the resulting MeasureReport to the Receving System|
|Alternative Courses:|N\A|
|Exceptions:|If the data doesn't meet reporting requirements, the measure cannot be submitted<br/>If the data doesn't conform to apprepriate profiles, steps need to be taken to address, report violations as part of the reponse and require a resubmit|

###### User Stories

1. System Administration
    1. Provider implementer
        1. As a Provider implementer, I need to be able to understand the measure calculation tool and how I can use it in my environment to support provider reporting
2. Site/Facility Registration/Maintenance
    1. Provider quality improvement administrator
        1. As a provider quality improvement administrator, I need to be able to configure the CCN for the reporting provider organization
        1. As a provider quality improvement administrator, I need to be able to configure the receiving system endpoint where I will submit reporting data.
        1. As a provider quality improvement administrator, I need to be able to register a facility for the reporting provider organization, including the base URL for the FHIR server providing data.
        1. As a provider quality improvement administrator, I need to be able to update the registration for a facility for the reporting provider organization, including the base URL for the FHIR server providing data.
        1. As a provider quality improvement administrator, I need to be able to remove the registration for a facility for the reporting provider organization.
3. Validation/Certification
    1. Provider implementer
        1. As a Provider implementer, I need to be able to validate that the data needed for provider reporting is available and conformant from my sites
